      "<section> Abstract </section> English noun phrases (NP) which include degree modified adjectives show some interesting variation of the position of the indefinite article. A particularly salient pattern is displayed in <mentioned> This is anticipated to be more common a scenario than fleas spreading bubonic plague </mentioned> (BoE, BU-NX022521). The present paper is based on a study of utterances where this pattern was used even though a canonical word order would have been possible. Such constructs are referred to as the Optional Postposed Indefinite Article Noun Phrase (OPIANP) and have been collected from the British National Corpus (BNC) and Collins Word Banks Online : English Corpus (BoE). The central question is whether there is semantic motivation for this postposition of the indefinite article. The results suggest that there is such motivation, namely that the OPIANP could be an extension of a more frequent construction identified as the Postposed Indefinite Article Noun Phrase (PIANP). Furthermore, it is shown that the pattern' s semantics is unpredictable from the composition of its parts and that its primary function is that it positions already given arguments on an adjectival scale. That is, it foregrounds scalar qualities and backgrounds the noun. These conclusions stem from observations of patterns of unification with other constructions, illustrating how the OPIANP unifies best with the non-referential, descriptive PC-constructions and less well with referential constructions such as the subject and direct object constructions. These findings are remarkable as the idea of an adjective-scalar centred NP-construction challenges the idea of NPs being centred round their head, the noun. Keywords Indefinite article, construction, construction grammar, OPIANP, PIANP, cognitive linguistics, degree modification, unification, semantic motivation, scalarity, noun phrase. <section> Table of contents </section> <section> 1. Introduction </section> <section> 1.1. General background </section> English noun phrases that include degree modified adjectives display some interesting variation as regards the position of the indefinite article. For instance, consider the different positions illustrated in the following phrases :- a pretty nice car quite a big house A more striking noun phrase structure may be that in sentence (1) (sample sentences have throughout this paper been given emphases for illustrative purposes) : (1 <mentioned>) It was therefore very useful a tool for the Party to adopt during this period of experimentation of how to achieve successful reconstruction of the countryside </mentioned>. (BNC, KM6 4) An important note is that the position of the indefinite article is optional in the case of the noun phrase pattern under study. This is to say that a canonical word order would have been possible in sentences such as (1) (see section 2.3 on word order optionality). The structure exemplified above will be referred to as the Optional Postposed Indefinite Article Noun Phrase (OPIANP). As will be seen in section 3.2, previous accounts of this pattern have been limited to formal notes on its structure. Proponents of Construction Grammar, however, have emphasized the importance of acknowledging a motivation for any construction' s syntactic form. For example, Goldberg notes that <quote> \" the syntax of the construction is motivated by its semantics \" </quote> (1995 : 201). She also comments that <quote> \" any phrasal constructions will differ either semantically or pragmatically (or both) \" </quote> and that <quote> \" functional motivations often underlie seemingly idiosyncratic facts of grammar \" </quote> (Goldberg 2006 : 95, 181). Lakoff introduces the same idea by saying that \" the parameters of linguistic form in grammatical constructions are ... motivated ... on the basis of meaning \" (1987 : 463, original italics). It is the question of whether there is such semantic motivation for the OPIANP that is the primary focus of this paper. <section> 1.2. An outline of the form of the OPIANP </section> The OPIANP may be characterized as an indefinite noun phrase minimally displaying an adjective phrase consisting of intensifier and adjective, and an indefinite article in post-AP position followed by a noun although the canonical word order is possible. The phrase must thus consist of at least four elements : an intensifier, an adjective, an indefinite article, and a noun. Although even non-gradable adjectives may often be shifted <quote> \" from nonscalar into scalar meanings \" </quote> (Paradis 2008 : 328), it may be said that it appears that the adjective must be gradable in the OPIANP. The four elements may to some extent be elaborated. Permitted elaborations are postmodifications of the noun, as in (2), and further elaborations within the AP, as for instance elaborations of the intensifier, as in (3) below : (2) <mentioned> A new recital from Nikolai Petrov is quite overwhelming a tour de force of breathtaking virtuoso pianism. </mentioned> (BNC, BMC 802) (3) <mentioned> The result is that men and women inhabit different leisure worlds ; in access to leisure activities, class is very much less important a variable than gender. </mentioned> (BNC, F9S 1681) Interestingly, the OPIANP may take two different forms of an adjective, depending on which intensifier is used. These are the positive form and the comparative form, respectively. The two variants are illustrated in (4) and (5) below : (4) <mentioned> that' s quite useful a lesson for them to get over to people </mentioned> (BNC, KGK 82) (5) <mentioned> mind you we had much worse a problem that day ... </mentioned> (BNC, KGK 119) Whenever the intensifier requires a subsequent comparative form and no morphological form of the adjective is available, the periphrastic form is used. (It appears that the intensifier, rather than the adjective, sets the elaboration of the scale, and that the form of the adjective is then dependent on the intensifier (see Paradis 2008 on the dominance of degree modifiers).) There are thus two importantly different variants of the construction. Whereas intensifiers such as much, far, less, and more inherently suggest comparison with another entity along the scale denoted by an adjective, intensifiers such as very, quite and really only suggest a categorical reading along the scale the adjective denotes. That is, there is one form of the OPIANP which offers the possibility of a relative reading, and another form that evokes a categorical one. <section> 1.3. Delimitation </section> There are a number of other constructions that display a postposition of the indefinite article but which will not be considered in this paper. A few such constructions are given below : (6) <mentioned> But this recession is quite a problem </mentioned>. (BNC, KC0 3349) (7) <mentioned> I think that smoked salmon in quiches is rather an extravagance </mentioned>. (BNC, ABB, 2333) (8) <mentioned> This report made such an impact that two other groups wrote answers to it </mentioned>. (BNC, A68 1591) (9) <mentioned> Now that might not be such a bad thing </mentioned>. (BNC, AC3 1695) (10 <mentioned>)' What an idiot I' ve been!' </mentioned> (BNC, JXS 3514) (11) <mentioned> His replacement was no less a man than the Mayor of Henley ... </mentioned> (BNC, AMY 769) It is also possible that sentences such as (12) may occur in some dialects. (12) <mentioned> The army is in far worse of a state nowadays </mentioned>. <footnote>001</footnote> Although these constructions could be related to the OPIANP, they fall beyond the scope of the present paper and will not be commented on further. <section> 1.4. Research questions </section> In this paper, the following research questions will be addressed : Is the meaning of the OPIANP predictable from the meaning of its component parts or from other constructions in the English language, or should it be treated as a construction in the sense of Construction Grammar? What formal and semantic constraints does the OPIANP display? What other constructions may the OPIANP be related to? And, consequently, might there be a semantic motivation for the OPIANP? <section> 2. Method and material </section> To gather material for this paper two corpora have been used. These are The British National Corpus (BNC) and Collins Word Banks Online : English Corpus (BoE). They have been chosen on the basis of their encompassing text (both spoken and written) from a wide variety of contexts, something that should ensure relative representativeness among the data. <section> 2.1. Collins Word Banks Online : English Corpus </section> The BoE is the larger of the two corpora, with a total of some 550 million tokens. The corpus contains text from a wide variety of sources, such as newspapers, books, news broadcasting, magazines, spoken text. The BoE also covers many different varieties of English, although the greatest amount of data emanates from British and American English. Although the corpus includes language of a variety of types, it should be noted that written language in various forms constitutes by far the largest part of the corpus. The distribution between spoken and written text is 11.12 % and 88.88 %, respectively. <footnote>002</footnote> <section> 2.2. The British National Corpus </section> The BNC encompasses somewhat less than 100 million words, and includes only British English. This corpus too consists of text from a variety of sources such as written material from for example the domains of fiction, Natural Science, Social Science, Commerce and spoken text from primarily two different domains : one that is labelled Spontaneous Conversational Interaction (amounting to approximately 40 % of the spoken subcorpus) and a second one, of a task-oriented nature (amounting to the remaining 60 %). The spoken subcorpus constitutes 10.38 % of the BNC, whereas the written subcorpus amounts to 89.62 %. (Boberg, 2009 : 3-4) The proportions are, hence, relatively similar to those of the BoE. <section> 2.3. Collection of data </section> The two corpora are both tagged for word classes. It has therefore been possible to search for a whole structure and not merely for specific words, such that the two corpora have been well suited for the types of searches required to retrieve samples of the OPIANP. However, there have been certain limitations to the two corpora' s search tools. For instance, the BNC does not allow for a search for a sequence of four word classes occurring in a specific order if instances of all the four word classes in question occur more than 10,000,000 times in the corpus. This renders impossible an open search such as \" Adverb+Adjective+Indefinite Article+Noun \". Furthermore, it has not been possible to search for specific subcategories of adverbs and articles, something that would have made \" an open search \" too broad to be manageable as it would have resulted in too many irrelevant matches, that is, matches that were not instances of the OPIANP. To overcome this problem a list of intensifiers was composed (see appendix A), in order for the searches to be specified as regards that slot in the sequence. This list was composed by extracting words and word sequences found under the label \" degree adverbs \" in Carter & McCarthy' s <mentioned> Cambridge Grammar of English, A Comprehensive Guide </mentioned> (2006 : 238, 245b, 330, 441), and the degree modifiers given in Paradis' s <mentioned> Degree Modifiers of Adjectives in Spoken British English </mentioned> (1997 : Appendix B). Additionally, given the relative infrequency of the OPIANP (resulting in a need to achieve as exhaustive a search as possible of the corpora), intensifiers were added to the list until a total number of 60 was reached, which was assumed to be sufficiently comprehensive. The corpora were then searched for the sequence \" X+Adjective+a/an+Noun \" where X stands for the intensifier that was slotted in before each search. This procedure results in two searches per degree modifier as there are two indefinite articles in English. All matches were then sifted through, and all instances of the OPIANP were extracted and assembled into a list of samples amounting to 93 occurrences (see Appendix B). An occurrence of the OPIANP was identified by the criterion that the word order must be optional. Optionality is here based on the intensifier in question occurring in the corpora not only in the structure of the OPIANP but also with equivalent components in canonical order. All \" coincidental \" occurrences of instances of the four word classes turning up in the desired order but not because the OPIANP was used, as for example in (13) and (14), were disregarded. (13) <mentioned> when I was very small a girl up the road was given a bike ... </mentioned> (BNC, KC0 847) (14) <mentioned> Oh I' ve been quite lucky a lot of times </mentioned>. (BoE, SB1----0908) Additionally, a sample of 100 NPs displaying canonical word order was collected to work as a reference during the analyses of the OPIANP. These were collected somewhat more randomly. The BNC was searched for NPs that consisted of the same components as those found in the OPIANP and were introduced by any of the three most common intensifiers found in the OPIANPs. These are more, less and far. The first 30 matches of NPs introduced by each respective intensifier were extracted disregarding what nouns acted as heads. As a complement, since this is a relatively frequent form in the sample of OPIANPs, the intensifier far succeeded by the periphrastic (more) form of the comparative (cf. section 4.2.2) was searched for, thus adding the last 10 samples before the total of 100 canonical NPs was reached (see Appendix C). To avoid reference data being unrepresentative due to possible influences of the nature of the head noun, when the BNC provided more than 10 matches for the structure wanted, all of which were headed by the same noun, only the 10 first instances of the NP structure were extracted. Samples of the same structure headed by the next noun provided by the BNC' s search engine were then collected. Using the same method, 100 NPs where the structure of the OPIANP is obligatory (cf. section 3.2.1) were collected. These were collected for the intensifiers too, that, so and as (see Appendix D). <footnote>003</footnote> The 93 instances of the OPIANP have then been studied with regard to the research questions presented in section 1.2. <section> 3. Theoretical background </section> <section> 3.1. Constructions and semantic motivations </section> <section> 3.1.1. Defining a construction </section> The present paper will rely on the definition of constructions as <quote> \" form-meaning pairs ... [ which ] can have unique semantic features associated with them that are not contributed by, or reducible to, other constructions, i.e. other form-meaning combinations \" </quote> (McMillion 2006 : 144). <section> 3.1.2. The notion of semantic motivation </section> Throughout this paper the notion of semantic motivation will be dealt with quite broadly. It will be in line with the idea that \" [ m ] otivation ... lies in between predictability and arbitrariness. In an intuitive sense, it will often constitute explanation. \" (Goldberg 1995 : 69). It will also be taken to include, for instance, the idea that <quote> \" functional motivations often underlie seemingly idiosyncratic facts of grammar \" </quote> (Goldberg 2006 : 181) as well as the idea that different constructions are used to highlight different aspects of a frame or, in the words of Goldberg, that <quote> \" one or more attributes are highlighted in each extension [ of a construction ] \" </quote> (2006 : 170). Also, it should be noted that <quote> \" [ t ] he form-meaning correspondences of noncentral clause structures are highly motivated- by their relation to more central structures ... \" </quote> (Lakoff 1987 : 464). This is important because it indicates that relations with other constructions in the language may constitute motivation. <section> 3.2. Insufficient previous coverage </section> <section> 3.2.1. Huddleston & Pullum </section> In Huddleston & Pullum (2002 : 435) mention is made of what they label \" Adjectival predeterminers \". Under the label \" AdjPs introduced by the degree modifiers as, so, how, too, this and that \" they introduce a noun phrase structure similar to that of the OPIANP. It differs, however, in that <quote> \" AdjPs of this form can function as pre-head modifier only in external position, before a \" </quote> (Huddleston & Pullum, 2002 : 435). Huddleston & Pullum (2002 : 435) give the following examples : <mentioned> It' s [ as fine a show as I' ve seen ] </mentioned>. <mentioned> It' s [ so good a bargain I can' t resist buying it ] </mentioned>. <mentioned> [ How serious a problem ] is it? </mentioned> Furthermore, mention is also made of \" AdjPs introduced by the degree adverbs more and less \", and it is noted that <quote> \" [ w ] ith AdjPs of this form, there is alternation between the external position ... and the internal [ one ] ... \" </quote> (Huddleston & Pullum 2002 : 435). Huddleston & Pullum hereby touch upon the OPIANP. However, they seem to treat this alternation simply as a formal matter, making no mention of when, how or for what purposes the different positions may be used. Additionally, Huddleston & Pullum do not allow for other intensifiers to take a similar position, thus denying the possibility of there being a skeletal construction in the sense of Goldberg (1995, 2006) that may be filled by the slotting in of individual words. In fact, Huddleston & Pullum (2002 : 550) impose two conditions on a phrasal pattern where the indefinite article is postposed : \" <mentioned> AdjPs occurring in predeterminer position in NP structure, before the article a, must meet one or the other of the following conditions </mentioned> : [ 40 ] i <mentioned> The AdjP begins with one of the modifiers how, as, so, too, this, that </mentioned>. <mentioned> ii The AdjP has such or exclamative what as head. \" </mentioned> They thus mark as ungrammatical sentences such as <quote> \" *They have quite big a house \" </quote> and <quote> \" *It' s excessively big a risk \" </quote> (Huddleston & Pullum 2002 : 551). In this way, the two authors not only fail to account for the properties and the usage of the OPIANP, but actually deny its existence. We will return to the \" Adjectival predeterminers \" in sections 4.4 and 4.5. <section> 3.2.2. Quirk et al </section> Quirk et al, too, touch upon the pattern of the OPIANP, albeit only in passing. It is noted that <quote> \" [ t ] he normal position for the adjective phrase is shown in the example for (v), but it can also be preposed [ 2 ] \" </quote> (Quirk et al 1985 : 1135). Their respective examples (taken from Quirk et al 1985 : 1134, 1135) are : <mentioned> It was a more heated discussion than we thought it would be </mentioned>. <mentioned> It was more heated a discussion than we thought it would be </mentioned>. Although throughout their accounts of noun phrases various other variations in word order are treated as regards their possible meaning differences, no further treatment of this pattern is offered. It thus appears that it is regarded as a formal alternation without significant influences on the meaning of the phrase. <section> 3.2.3. Adopting a different view </section> As is apparent, previous treatments of the noun phrase pattern of the OPIANP have been unsatisfactory. Not only have the accounts of the pattern been largely formal, but the OPIANP has also, at least when introduced by other degree modifiers than more and less, been treated as unacceptable. This runs contrary to a usage-based approach to language (adopted here e.g. through the present study' s being corpus-based) along the lines of which <quote> \" what you see is what you get \" </quote> (Goldberg 2003 : 590, see Goldberg 2006 : 45, 64-5 on a usage-based approach). Such treatments also fail to account for how this form may be semantically motivated, an aspect of constructions whose importance has been outlined in section 1. It is against such a background that the present paper aims at providing a more adequate and exhaustive account of how the OPIANP is actually used, and how it may be characterized semantically as well as formally. <section> 4. Results and analyses </section> <section> 4.1. Syntactic functions </section> Table 1, below, lists the verbs that functioned as predicates in the clauses in which the OPIANPs occurred, the syntactic functions performed by the OPIANPs in each clause, the actual instantiations of the OPIANP and possible further comments on interesting aspects of the OPIANP in each particular sentence. The numbers in the left column correspond to the numbers given to the samples in Appendix B. What may be considered remarkable about this mapping of the syntactic functions performed by the OPIANPs is that a full 80 out of the 93 OPIANPs function as predicative complements (PC). Apart from these, 9 examples occur as nominal complements within prepositional phrases (Comp of P), one as a complement of existential there, 3 as direct objects (dO). The clear predominance of PCs is remarkable since a comparison with the reference samples collected for the canonical word order (cf. table 2) shows that this is not the general picture for NPs consisting of the same components in canonical order. The numbers in the left column in table 2 below correspond to the numbers given to the samples in Appendix C. Observing table 2, it may be noted that only 9 PCs occur, whereas as much as 45 direct objects and 35 nominal complements of prepositional phrases are found. Apart from these, the table contains 6 subjects (Subj), 4 complements of existential there and one sentence in which the syntactic function of the NP has not been determinable. As will be seen in section 4.3.1, the remarkable pattern of the OPIANPs' syntactic functions may be accounted for by assuming an AP-centrality of the construction. (Central, here, means that a feature is prominent in a construction. The term is used synonymously to highlighted and foregrounded and contrasts with peripheral and backgrounded.) <section> 4.2. Formal constraints </section> <section> 4.2.1. Phrasal level of modification </section> An important formal constraint of the OPIANP is that it may only take intensifiers that directly modify the quality denoted by the adjective. That is, it is not sufficient to add extra weight to the clause as a whole. Compare the following : (15) <mentioned> *Really, this is interesting a question </mentioned>. (16) <mentioned> *This really is interesting a question </mentioned>. (17) <mentioned> *This is interesting a question, really </mentioned>. (18) <mentioned> This is really interesting a question </mentioned>. Furthermore, that intensification must occur on phrasal level explains why certain degree modifiers fail to warrant an employment of the OPIANP. To the extent that <quote> \" longer degree adverbs ... [ that ] ... normally occupy end or front position [ in a sentence ] \" </quote> (Carter & McCarthy, 2006 : 590) are allowable in a position that would seem to be the same as that of intensifiers permissible in the OPIANP, they still do not warrant a word order switch. Thus the following pattern : (19) <mentioned> This is to some extent an interesting question </mentioned>. (20) <mentioned> *This is to some extent interesting a question </mentioned>. (21) <mentioned> This is quite an interesting question </mentioned>. (22) <mentioned> This is quite interesting a question </mentioned>. Along the same lines, it may be noted that (23) below differs marginally in meaning from (24), whereas (25) differs quite clearly from (26) : (23) <mentioned> This is to some extent an interesting question </mentioned>. (24) <mentioned> To some extent, this is an interesting question </mentioned>. (25) <mentioned> This is a really interesting question </mentioned>. (26) <mentioned> Really, this is an interesting question </mentioned>. It must be noted, however, that it is not such longer intensifiers' internal syntactic structure that makes them unacceptable, but that they fail to modify the adjective directly. Since the adjective-scalar properties are central to the OPIANP, as will be shown in section 4.3.1, attempts to use the OPIANP with an intensifier that does not give direct modification of the adjective, such as in (20) above, run contrary to the semantics of the construction and are thus unacceptable. This constraint also shows in the fact that all intensifiers occurring in the sample of 93 OPIANPs may be said to be highly configurational (see Paradis 2001, 2008 on configurational versus content structures). That a non-syntactic build-up of intensifiers is not a constraint is illustrated by the acceptability of (27) : (27) <mentioned> Molecule for molecule, methane is many times more powerful a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide </mentioned>. <footnote>004</footnote> (BoE, MB2--990130) Finally, it must be noted that the OPIANP is not restricted to an intensifier' s taking a pre-head position within the AP, but only to the modification being within the actual AP. Therefore, an intensifier that takes a postmodifying position is not rejected as long as it directly modifies the adjective. Thus : (28) <mentioned> The grilling given by assembled worthies to the BBC brass was so limp that \" obsequious \" is not oily enough a word to describe it </mentioned>. (BoE, NB2--980721) 4.2.2. Allowing for more (or less) An interesting feature of the OPIANP is that it allows not only for typical intensifiers such as very, quite, and really to trigger it, but also for more and less to do so. What is not sufficient to warrant a word order switch, however, is a morphological form of the comparative of an adjective. Although more and less are often noted as variants of the comparative form of an adjective (see e.g. Croft & Cruse 2004 : 178, Paradis 2001 : 56, Huddleston & Pullum 2002 : 1123, Quirk et al 1985 : 403), the question may thus be asked whether these periphrastic comparatives are indeed comparable to the morphological form. The fact that the two periphrastic forms more and less may occupy the intensifier slot in the OPIANP suggests that they are not merely comparatives. Although it is admittedly difficult to perceive a difference in meaning from what the idea of a comparative would bring in a sentence such as (29) below, more has nonetheless often been treated as eligible as an intensifier too. This is done by both Huddleston & Pullum (2002 : 435) and Quirk et al (1985 : 1134). Sentence (29) is quoted from Quirk et al (1985 : 1134). (29) <mentioned> It was a more heated discussion than we thought it would be </mentioned>. Although without an example of when it would take this function, Croft & Cruse too include more amongst <quote> \" intensifiers such as more, fairly, quite, rather, extremely \" </quote> (2004 : 186). For the present purposes the treatment of more and less as intensifiers will be accepted since this is supported by their acceptability in the intensifier slot in the OPIANP. It will be held, however, since this appears inevitable if the nature of the primary data of this paper is to be taken into account, that more and less do not only function as intensifiers, but also maintain a comparative quality in the OPIANP. It should also be noted that more and less may unproblematically function as periphrastic forms of the comparative in the OPIANP if another intensifier occupies the intensifier slot. This is illustrated in sentence (30) : (30) <mentioned> However, nicotine stains are far more likely a cause </mentioned>. (BoE, NBA--020516) <section> 4.3. Semantic properties </section> <section> 4.3.1. The adjective-scalar centrality </section> Although treatments of proper names are not directly relevant to this study, it is interesting to see that Huddleston & Pullum (2002 : 401) note that <quote> \" [ t ] he proper name Mary ... may be used non-referentially even when it constitutes a full NP \" </quote>. What makes this comment relevant is that it seems to suggest that full NPs are typically used referentially. The OPIANP, it might be recalled, is a full NP. This makes it even more remarkable that the OPIANP is predominantly used as a predicative complement since <quote> \" a PC characteristically expresses a property \" </quote> and <quote> \" [ t ] he prototypical PC ... is non-referential \" </quote> (Huddleston & Pullum 2002 : 253, 254). The distribution of syntactic functions seen in table 1 may be accounted for by assuming that the OPIANP is a construction primarily centred round the scalar qualities expressed in the AP component. Assuming this would be in line with the note that <quote> \" AdjPs denote properties but are not used referentially \" </quote> (Huddleston & Pullum 2002 : 253). This may thus explain why the OPIANP displays such a striking preference for predicative function. As it is reasonable to believe that any construction will unify most successfully with other constructions whose properties do not lead to conflict (cf. Goldberg 2006 : 10, 22, Takahashi 2008), this would mean that if the OPIANP carries properties similar to that of the PC-constructions, it is with these constructions that it will unify. The assumption of central scalar qualities would predict that the OPIANP is not appropriate when there is an expectation of a categorization rather than a characterization. This is to say that it would predict that the OPIANP would not unify well with for instance the subject or direct object constructions as these are typically referential and not descriptive elements. This prediction appears to be correct. Consider the following : (31) <mentioned>?? Really old a man started talking to me today </mentioned>. (subject) (32) <mentioned>? I met very nice a guy yesterday </mentioned>. (direct object) <section> 4.3.2 Consequences on information structure </section> The importance of paying attention to information structure was stressed by Goldberg in Constructions at Work as she commented that <quote> \" [ i ] gnoring the information-structure properties of constructions is like trying to account for evolution without reference to natural selection \" </quote> (2006 : 228). In fact, information structure may be one of the important aspects in which the OPIANP carries non-predictable characteristics. It was noted in the previous section that the OPIANP is unlikely to be used when there is an expectation of a categorization rather than a characterization of an argument. Conversely, then, the employment of the OPIANP is likely to be acceptable when the argument it characterizes has already been established in the discourse and adjectival properties are more relevant. In fact, there is support for this idea in the simple clause structures typical of PCs. Such complements typically fall into two patterns : (33) <mentioned> This is very important </mentioned>. (34) <mentioned> You are making this very difficult </mentioned>. What is interesting about these patterns is that both the PCs characterize an argument that has been given just before the PC occurs. The argument described by the PC can thus be assumed to be activated in the minds of the language user(s) (cf. Van Gompel & Pickering 2007 : 289). In fact, it may also be noted that the OPIANP has been seen (cf. table 1 above) to be used as a type of predicative complement of an argument even without a verb that would have denoted the relationship between them (cf. Ungerer & Schmid 2006 : 177). This may be seen as support for the reasoning above as it suggests that the OPIANP may be used when an argument is so activated that it is still clear that a descriptive element would give a description of that argument. It would thus be reasonable to assume that giving a category for the nominal is perceived as less important, and thus the OPIANP may be utilized to foreground adjective-scalar qualities instead. It may also be considered remarkable that there is an indefinite NP that appears to be almost exclusively restricted to occurring in predicative complement function, despite previous research saying that indefinite NPs are typically the type chosen to introduce new arguments (Goldberg 2006 : 129, Gundel et al 1993 : 276). This too indicates that the OPIANP carries a meaning unpredictable from its component parts, a characteristic that may in fact be seen as the criterion for regarding a pattern as <quote> \" a prototypical construction in the sense of construction grammar \" </quote> (Verhagen 2005 : 79). Finally, it should be noted that <quote> \" [ m ] ost types of NP can be used either referentially or non-referentially \" </quote> (Huddleston & Pullum 2002 : 401). This applies also to the OPIANP, as it is on a few sparse occasions used referentially. Some of these are : (35) but mind you we had much worse a problem that day because we had two sets of sniffer dogs who didn' t like something (BNC, KGK 119) (36) But there was even more serious a problem, in Cesare' s mind. (BoE, BU--M012132) (37) quite small an equation I think you' ve chosen with the problem. (BoE, SB1----0394) Non-referentiality is thus not a semantic constraint on the OPIANP, but appears to be a consequence of its being centred on adjective-scalar qualities. However, even in the cases where the OPIANP is used referentially, it should be noted that the category denoted by the noun has either already been mentioned or is easily constructed on the basis of the preceding discourse. The influences of such information are touched upon by Ungerer & Schmid as they comment that <quote> \" the preceding context does play an important role in the cognitive processing of the expression \" </quote> and speak of an <quote> \" online conceptual representation, constructed under the influence of the incoming information but tapping stored cognitive models \" </quote> (2006 : 258). <section> 4.3.3. Non-predictability </section> It was shown above that the OPIANP carries the semantic property of being centred round adjective-scalar properties, and that it deviates from the patterns of syntactic functions displayed by a reference sample of canonical NPs (see table 2) in which, for instance, a distinctly larger tendency towards referentiality is observable. The semantics of the OPIANP may thus not be predicted from its component parts and its semantic properties are thus not merely compositional. The question may also be addressed whether it is possible to deduce an increased centrality in the AP qualities of the NP from viewing the OPIANP as a noun phrase in which one element is fronted and thus highlighted. Such a view would suggest that the meaning of the OPIANP is predictable from general patterns of fronting within the English language. However, the idea of one element being fronted requires a starting point from which one structure is considered more basic and the other an alternation from this basic pattern. What is central here is that within the construction grammar framework there are <quote> \" no underlying levels of syntax \" </quote> (Goldberg 2003 : 590). This means that syntactic patterns are not generated or derived from other, underlying structures, but should be treated as constructions in their own right, provided that they fit the definition of a construction (see section 3.1.1). Therefore, it may be held that the phrase initial AP in the OPIANP does not need to be considered as a type of fronted AP, generated from the word order given in canonical NPs. Instead, it may be claimed that it is part of the semantics of the OPIANP itself to highlight adjective-scalar qualities. The idea that the OPIANP, as well as other potentially related constructions (cf. section 4.4 below), are not generated from some more basic, underlying canonical word order is supported by the fact that not all NPs incorporating the four elements found in the OPIANP allow for the canonical order (see Huddleston & Pullum 2002 : 435). This may be compared to the note made by cognitive linguists that the passive voice, for example, can not be generated from a sentence in active voice since not all passives are accepted in the active voice (Taylor 2003 : 224). <section> 4.4 A skeletal construction </section> Having outlined the form and semantic properties of the OPIANP, it may be reasonable to ask whether there are other, closely related constructions. Goldberg (1995:108) notes that, within the framework of construction grammar, <quote> \" relations involving both form and meaning (or sometimes just form ...) are explicitly represented by positing inheritance links \" </quote>. It may thus be interesting to look for other constructions with a form similar to that of the OPIANP. Huddleston & Pullum (cf. section 3.2.1) noted that adjective phrases introduced by the intensifiers so, too, as, how, this and that display a formal constraint of a postposed indefinite article. This means that the postposition of the indefinite article is obligatory in (38) -(45) below. Another few intensifiers that enforce the non-canonical word order, found as <quote> \" coincidental matches \" </quote> (cf. section 2.3) during the collection of data for this paper, are also displayed below : (38) <mentioned> The Clarion was all the more popular a paper because it was not in the least doctrinaire </mentioned>. (BoE, BB-ZM042721) (39) <mentioned> Yet it was so great a task that only Zeus, chief of the gods, could master it </mentioned>. (BNC, ARG 467) (40) <mentioned> they had never seen so good a man </mentioned> ... (BNC, ASW 572) (41) <mentioned> Moreover, there is no more obvious a service industry than retail </mentioned>. (BoE, NB2- 990627) (42) <mentioned> They hadn' t planned on this big a kill </mentioned>! (BoE, BU-jM931100) (43) <mentioned> It' s not that big a deal </mentioned>. (BoE, BB--F86-923) (44) <mentioned>' I think raid is too strong a word,' he said </mentioned>. (BNC, K5D 3889) (45) <mentioned> That is, the more affluent a writer, the less significant his writing </mentioned>. (BoE, NI2- 000220) What is noticeable is that all noun phrases illustrated in (38) -(44) show a structure identical to that of the OPIANP. This leads to the idea that the postposition of the indefinite article in the OPIANP might be the result of an extension of a skeletal construction with the structure \" intensifier+adjective+indefinite article+noun \", a skeletal construction which may be labelled the Postposed Indefinite Article Noun Phrase (PIANP) and which is required by the intensifiers in sentences (38) -(44). It may also be noted that the PIANP, when introduced for instance by the intensifiers too, so, this and that, is a far more frequent construction than the OPIANP and that it may thus be assumed to be firmly entrenched. Important here is Goldberg' s note that <quote> \" [ i ] f construction A is related to construction B formally, then construction A is motivated to the degree that it is related to construction B semantically \" </quote> (2006 : 218). Having noted that the structure of the two is the same, we may thus look for what similarities and differences there are between the PIANP and the OPIANP. This is done in section 4.5 below. Additionally, sentence (45) above is an instantiation of the Comparative Correlative Construction (also called the the X-er the Y-er Construction). Although this construction' s form is not identical to the OPIANP' s, it too displays a similar postposition of the indefinite article. Falling back upon this construction' s denoting principally <quote> \" the comparative correlation of two scales of magnitude \" </quote> or, more specifically, <quote> \" a correlation between an independent variable and a dependent variable \" </quote>, it may thus be suggested that the OPIANP could be related to this construction, and thus motivated by it, through both of them displaying adjective-scalar centrality (Culicover & Jackendoff 1999 : 569, Fillmore, Kay & O' Connor 1988 : 506). <section> 4.5. Differences between the OPIANP and the PIANP </section> In this section it will be suggested that, although it shares the skeletal structure of the PIANP, the OPIANP differs as regards the scalar qualities its instantiations display. It will also be shown that the OPIANP and the PIANP display partially similar syntactic behaviour. This suggests that the OPIANP is motivated but not predicted by the existence of the PIANP, and that it could be an extension of the PIANP. This extension may complement the range of scalar perspectives possible in the PIANP and appears more limited in its syntactic behaviour, perhaps due to its being less entrenched in the minds of speakers of the English language. In the sections below, the intensifier how is disregarded. This is because, although it occurs in a structure similar to that of the PIANP, how appears to be directly dependent on the interrogative and exclamative constructions. These are highly abstract constructions (cf. Tomasello 2003 : 100-101, 158-159), and therefore, together with how, fall beyond the scope of this paper. <section> 4.5.1. Scale delineations </section> Some interesting differences between the PIANP and the OPIANP may be identified as regards scalar properties. Most importantly, none of the intensifiers that require a postposition of the indefinite article, and thus occur in the PIANP, give the same scalar qualities as the instantiations of the OPIANP. Most strikingly, in fact, all the intensifiers that require a postposition of the indefinite article appear to evoke categorical readings and a fixed point along the scale denoted by the adjective. The OPIANPs, on the other hand, do not display these same features. This is illustrated below, and shows an important difference between the PIANP and the OPIANP. <section> Figure 1. Scale delineation of I think raid is too strong a word ... </section> As is illustrated in figure 1, the intensifier too evokes a categorical reading where a fixed point on the scale appears to constitute a limit that has been transgressed. <section> Figure 2. Scale delineation of They hadn' t planned on this big a kill! </section> As can be seen in figure 2, the intensifier this suggests a categorical reading with a specific point along the scale denoted by the adjective. There also appears to be an expected quantity along the scale, here given as norm. The intensifier that may be said to evoke a similar scale, and the semantic difference between them may be said to be that this is perceived as proximal and that as distal. Furthermore, the intensifier so displays some interesting scalar features. <section> Figure 3. Scale delineation of Yet it was so great a task that only Zeus ... could master it. </section> <section> Figure 4. Scale delineation of they had never seen so good a man ... </section> As is exemplified in figures 3 and 4, the intensifier so may evoke various scales all of which seem to evoke the image of a fixed point within one of the categories. In figure 3, the point is the one where it becomes impossible for anyone else than Zeus to master the task. In figure 4, the point is <mentioned> \" as good a man as they had seen before \" </mentioned>. Both readings are categorical. <section> Figure 5. Scale delineation of The Clarion was all the more popular a paper ... </section> As figure 5 illustrates, the intensifier all the seems to suggest a scale where an entity has first possessed a certain quantity of a property. A projection further up along the scale then occurs as an increase of the quantity is perceived. This projection appears to be unbounded. Interestingly, all the appears to enforce a categorical reading even though it gives the adjective in the comparative form. As may be seen in the figures above, the intensifiers given by Huddleston & Pullum, which require the postposition of the indefinite article, all seem to evoke a categorical reading with a fixed point along the scale. This is true also of the intensifier all the, which was not noted by Huddleston & Pullum but which appears to behave similarly. Furthermore, the fixed point also appears to apply to no and (not) any, which also require a postposition of the indefinite article but which were not noted by Huddleston & Pullum. These latter two intensifiers, however, bring in aspects of negation which in turn results in complications related to scale reversal (cf. Fauconnier 1975 or Israel 1996). Such matters are beyond the scope of this paper. Based on the figures above, it may be said that it is possible that all these intensifiers require the structure of the PIANP because of their similar scalar semantics. Assuming this to be the case, it may be suggested that the positional optionality of the intensifiers given in the OPIANPs could be a result of their carrying different scalar qualities. Although the scalar qualities of all instantiations of the OPIANP can not be delineated here, a few representative examples are outlined below to illustrate how the OPIANP differs from the PIANP as it allows for categorical readings without specific reference points (in the case of e.g. very and quite) as well as relative readings (in the case of e.g. more and far). <section> Figure 6. Scale delineation of It was therefore very useful a tool ... The two dotted lines conjoined by a dashed line indicate an approximate location along the scale. </section> As may be seen in figure 6, the intensifier very invokes a categorical reading along the scale denoted by the adjective. Furthermore, the entity possesses a large quantity of the property in question. However, no specific point is implied along the scale. <section> Figure 7. Scale delineation of It was quite hard a smack. The two dotted lines conjoined by a dashed line indicate an approximate location along the scale. </section> Figure 7, above, illustrates how the intensifier quite invokes a scale that is reminiscent of the one given by very. The difference lies principally in degree. The entity possesses less of the quality in question and thus the location closer to the centre of the scale than in the case of very. Still though, the reading is categorical. No specific point is implied along the scale. <section> Figure 8. Scale delineation of This is anticipated to be more common a scenario than fleas spreading bubonic plague. </section> As can be seen in figure 8, the intensifier more gives the possibility of a relative reading. This means that entity y possesses more of the quality denoted by the adjective than x does, but not necessarily sufficient of it to warrant a categorical reading. No indication is given of how much more of this adjectival quality is possessed by y, that is, how far apart the two entities are along the scale. <section> Figure 9. Scale delineation of I' m far more modest a dresser than my character ... </section> Finally, figure 9 shows how the intensifier far, too, gives the possibility of a relative reading. It, too, seems to suggest a comparison between two entities. It differs from more in that it suggests not only that one entity is understood as possessing more of the qualities denoted by the adjective, but that the two entities are far apart along the scale. Having seen the scalar delineations of the intensifiers given in the OPIANP it may be noted again that they, in contrast to the intensifiers given in the PIANP, do not seem to evoke the same categorical readings with reference to a specific point along the scale. <section> 4.5.2. Syntactic functions of the PIANP </section> Table 3, below, lists the verbs that functioned as the predicates of the clauses in which the PIANPs occurred, the syntactic functions performed by the PIANPs in each clause, the actual instantiations of the PIANP and possible further comments on interesting aspects of the PIANP in each particular sentence. There is not room here for a detailed analysis of the syntactic behaviour of the PIANPs, but it may be interesting to see that the different instantiations of the PIANP behave quite differently syntactically. Similarly to the OPIANP, the PIANP displays a clear tendency towards occurring as PCs when introduced by too or that. When introduced by either so or as, however, there is no such tendency. <footnote>005</footnote> This may suggest that the PIANP itself consists of several different extensions. All characteristics of these extensions, however, can not at this stage be explicated. However, one final aspect of the PIANP may be noted, namely that some of its extensions appear to unify better with referential constructions than the OPIANP does (cf. section 4.3.1). This may be seen in the intuitive acceptability of sentences (42) and (43) and further suggests that the PIANP and the OPIANP are related but not semantically equivalent. (42) <mentioned> When so large a part of modern politics, above all in America, is concerned with policies ... (subject) </mentioned> (BNC, A69 643) (43) <mentioned> If he does as good a job on the new houses then no one will object. (direct object) </mentioned> (BNC, JXV 2627) It was shown in section 4.3.1 that the OPIANP appears reluctant to unify with such constructions, especially when the category denoted by the noun is unanticipated. The OPIANP thus seems more limited in its syntactic behaviour. This, together with the comparison with the behaviour of canonical NPs, may be seen as support for the suggestion made in this paper that the meaning of the OPIANP is predictable neither from its component parts nor from other constructions in the language. Rather, along the tenets of the construction grammar framework, it appears to be motivated by (at least some of the extensions of) the PIANP (cf. Goldberg 2006 : 218 and Lakoff 1987). Adding together the data presented above, it may therefore be suggested that the OPIANP could be an extension of the PIANP, an extension which shares the skeletal form of the PIANP and displays a tendency towards unifying with PC-constructions, a tendency which is also found in some of the possible variants of the PIANP. The OPIANP, however, appears to denote different scalar perspectives and is overall more limited as regards its syntactic behaviour. <section> 4.6. Indications of a strong construction </section> There are a few further instantiations of the OPIANP that should be noted. Consider the following : (46) <mentioned> That sounds like more simple a matter than it is, in fact </mentioned>. (BoE, EU-----3540) (47) <mentioned> Unless we actively seek out such new projects and work hard at them, the lessons of this place may be taught us in even more severe a form </mentioned>. (BoE, BB-cM85--21) (48) <mentioned> This is anticipated to be more common a scenario than fleas spreading bubonic plague </mentioned>. (BoE, BU-NX022521) What makes these samples interesting is that they occur as OPIANPs with more, the intensifier or periphrastic form of the comparative, even though a morphological form of the adjective is possible. Indeed, at least with (46) the morphological form is the most frequent one. That these examples occur may perhaps be a result of the speaker' s using the OPIANP rather than a noun phrase structure such as <mentioned> \" a simpler matter \" </mentioned> because the OPIANP allows for a more centralized AP component. In fact, another two samples may be suggested to give a similar indication. (49) <mentioned> They may be quite large an volume in terms of transaction rates or users </mentioned>. (BNC, HEP 218) (50) <mentioned> If they really would want to be really clever a lawyer they could try and get the on the on site cleaning costs covered </mentioned>. (BoE, SB3--000564) Disregarding the fact that the \" wrong \" indefinite article occurs in (49) (as this may be a typing-error in transcription into the corpus), it is interesting that both the sentences above display disagreement between the antecedent and the number in the predicative complement. That is, both sentences give an antecedent in the plural and a predicative complement in the singular. Rather speculatively, this may be interpreted as the OPIANP being so strong a construction as to override the need for agreement as adjective-scalar centrality might not have been as successfully communicated through an ordinary structure such as <mentioned> \" quite large volumes \" </mentioned> or <mentioned> \" really clever lawyers \" </mentioned>. <section> 4.7. Problematic cases </section> It should be noted, finally, that there are a few examples of what forms a grey zone between the OPIANP and a canonical word order NP. This occurs with intensifiers such as \" a little \" or \" a lot \". (51) <mentioned> Well, that' s perhaps a little unfair a term. </mentioned> (BoE, NB6--020510) What makes this example interesting is that the indefinite article in a little has lost so much of its original meaning that it merges with little to form one unit (Quirk et al 1985 : 263). This might be why the indefinite article is then provided before the phrase-final noun. It is therefore difficult to determine whether the canonical word order is indeed possible, and thus whether the phrase above may be considered an instantiation of the OPIANP. It should be dealt with as an example of the OPIANP to the extent that sentence (52) is acceptable. (52) <mentioned>? Well, that' s an a little unfair term </mentioned>. It is beyond the scope of this paper to delve further into these semantic nuances. <section> 5. Summary and conclusions </section> In this paper, the results of a study of the noun phrase pattern referred to as the OPIANP have been presented. Semantic as well as formal constraints of the pattern have been discussed from a Construction Grammar, and thus cognitive linguistic, perspective, and it has been shown that the OPIANP displays various characteristics which are not predictable from the composition of its parts. It has been suggested that there is an entrenched skeletal construction, which was labelled the PIANP, from which the OPIANP may form an extension. The conclusion that the OPIANP may be an extension of this construction has been arrived at on the basis of the observations that the OPIANP shares the skeletal structure of the PIANP and displays a tendency in unification with other constructions which is similar to that of some of the variants of the PIANP, but differs in its scalar qualities and appears more reluctant to function referentially. Some remarkable features of the OPIANP have been found. For instance, the construction seems relatively restricted as regards its performance of syntactic functions. Also, the behaviour of the OPIANP deviates from that of canonical NPs and suggests that the construction is in fact adjective-scalar centred as it primarily ascribes properties to known arguments rather than acts referentially. It has thus been found that the OPIANP is relatively poorly suited for introducing new arguments to a discourse, as it foregrounds adjectival qualities. This is surprising because the category of NPs has previously been suggested to prototypically function referentially. Furthermore, it is remarkable that the OPIANP is an indefinite NP that acts primarily non-referentially to specify the characteristics of already known arguments. In fact, although indefinite NPs have been noted to be the typical choice for introducing new arguments to a discourse, the OPIANP seems to reject such usage. This may be considered an illustration of the importance of investigations of how different structures of NPs differ in usage. Moreover, it is interesting to note another consequence of the OPIANP' s being centred on adjectival properties. This may in fact be interpreted as contradicting the idea of NPs, by virtue of being noun phrases, being centred round their heads, the nouns. In fact, the question may be raised whether it is really appropriate to talk of a head noun if this component of the construction is actually so peripheral that it does not suffice to allow for this indefinite NP to perform functions noted as typical of indefinite NPs. This finding also suggests that aspects of a construction' s scalar qualities indeed deserve attention, as they may be vital to satisfactory analyses of linguistic data. On the basis of the above, it may be concluded that the form of the OPIANP is in fact motivated by its semantics, that it complements the scalar range of the PIANP, and that it deviates significantly from the instantiations of NPs of canonical word order. Additionally, this paper has given a more exhaustive and, it is hoped, more adequate account of the characteristics of the OPIANP (and the PIANP) than has previously been provided by Huddleston & Pullum (2002) and Quirk et al (1985). Lastly, it may be said that further research is necessary to outline more specifically how the OPIANP and the PIANP are related. It may finally be suggested that carrying out such research would be quite interesting a task. <section> References </section> <section> Appendix A </section> <section> Appendix B </section> <section> Appendix C </section> <section> Appendix D </section> <documentfootnotes> 001.

      "Multinational corporations operating in Sweden often use English as their official corporate language. The employees are expected to communicate using English both internally and with external business contacts. English used for communication between people with different mother tongues is commonly referred to as ELF, English as a Lingua Franca, and when used in business contexts it is referred to as Business English or BELF, Business English as a Lingua Franca. This study was conducted to explore how Business English is used in the pharmaceutical sector in Sweden and what elements of Business English are challenging or necessary for successful communication. In the study five informants were interviewed about their experiences. The study showed that the informants use Business English for all types of communication and are comfortable with English as a lingua franca yet often switch over to Swedish if there are only Swedish speakers present. It was also found that clear, somewhat simplified English with focus on content and getting business done was preferred over grammatically correct and native sounding English. The respondents viewed an industry specific vocabulary as highly important bordering to a pre-requisite. The findings of this study support previous research in the field indicating that there is little difference when it comes to Business English for the pharmaceutical industry compared to other industries. Keywords Business English, BELF, Business English as a Lingua Franca, English as a Lingua Franca. . Lingua franca is specified as language use in situations ; . In order to get deeper into the investigations of this study, the terms used for the discussion need to be clarified.' Lingua franca' in its strictest form is . When referring to English as a Lingua Franca, very often it is implied to be between non-native speakers of English. The English spoken in international settings is shaped by its users , and when taking into account that only one in four is a native speaker of English and 90% of the spoken English takes place between NNSs of English , it becomes clear that ELF is mainly shaped by NNSs of English. In spite of the NNSs dominance of the usage of English . English as a lingua franca, ELF is used in a wide variety of contexts and when used in a business context, it can be described as BELF rather than ELF . Stemming from ELF, the term BELF is described as : . Integral contextual features of the BELF discourse are : . Previous research also shows that there are three characteristic features that define proper BELF, namely ; . Furthermore, and several multinational companies operating in Sweden have English as their lingua franca. Professionals working in MNCs in the pharmaceutical sector are more or less expected to communicate with colleagues and business partners from all over the world in English. We may ask what language skills are fundamental in terms of Business English in order to be successful in communicating with others and what kind of issues emerge because of the language. In this study the informants are non-native English speakers but interact with both native English speakers as well as non-native English speakers when using Business English. For the purpose of this study the term Business English will be used to include both kinds of communicative interaction. This study will investigate how professionals working in the pharmaceutical sector in Sweden communicate in English at work. What do they find integral for success and what is challenging. In trying to find some answers to this I will in the following section begin with presenting the the aim and research questions. Thereafter, section 3 describes the method used for this study. It is followed by section 4 presenting the findings, a discussion in section 5, and finally section 6 will present conclusions from the study. Previous ELF and BELF research seems to agree that there is a vast difference between the English used in international communication situations and the English used between native speakers of English. Jenkins' research shows that neither pronunciation of sounds described as particularly English nor grammatical correctness are important factors for successful ELF communication . Similarly, Seidlhofer argues that the English necessary for successful and intelligible communication in ELF is based on general language awareness and communication strategies rather than . Kankaanranta and Planken describe BELF as a simplified language based on with little or no . Their study further showed that grammatical errors were common but of little consequence and that the interviewees had a positive attitude towards the simplified version of English used . Business communication experts would probably agree that BELF matters to the success in business. Kankaanranta & Planken argue that . Similarly, Nickerson concluded that . Furthermore, Ehrenreich reports in her study that the speakers of BELF adopt a pragmatic and flexible approach to the language use . This is similar to the findings of Louhiala-Salminen et al ; that the effectiveness is dictating the use of language rather than linguistic correctness . Yet little research has focused on which factors are key in order for BELF communication to be effective in the multinational pharmaceutical sector. Kankaanranta and Louhiala-Salminen conclude that ; . Also Charles found that although the discourse of BELF may vary from the native English-speaker discourse, the business at hand gets done. In other words, the focus of BELF is communication to conduct business rather than communication in correct, native-like language. Furthermore, the study by Rogerson-Revell gave inconclusive results when it came to the question whether the informants found it easier to communicate in English with NSs or with NNSs. In the study there were . On the other hand, the informants of Ehrenreich' s study described the communication with NS as often being more problematic, especially in situations of conflict. The informants were more hesitant to ask clarification questions to NS than NNSs and felt at a disadvantage in situations of conflict or negotiations. However, the communication with NSs was seen as less problematic when there was not a competitive threat involved . Several previous studies point to cultural differences as an important factor in communication. This study will not look further into the cultural differences that affect ELF and BELF but rather will touch upon and acknowledge them as one factor in the development of ELF, BELF and Business English. The aim of this study is to explore how English is used by professionals in the pharmaceutical sector in Sweden. The purpose is to find out what they think makes them successful when communicating using Business English and what hurdles they have experienced. It aims to establish what this particular group of professionals identifies as the key success factors and greatest challenges. This could potentially be an important insight in designing an ESP course specifically for professionals working in the pharmaceutical sector. In this study I seek to answer the following research questions : How do Swedish professionals working in the pharmaceutical sector use Business English at work? What is the Business English competence required to be successful in the pharmaceutical sector in Sweden? What are the major challenges to overcome in order to ensure successful Business English communication within the pharmaceutical sector in Sweden? For this study, it is presumed that the key success factors and challenges will resemble those of professionals working in other industries, perhaps with an added importance of the industry-specific vocabulary. The study was conducted in and around Stockholm, Sweden during November-December, 2011. Participants were interviewed about their usage of Business English as a Lingua Franca in the workplace. Specifically, they were asked about what they found successful as well as what they found to be troublesome in communicating in English. The results were then compared to previous research to find out if there were any indications that the professionals working in the pharmaceutical sector perceive to have the same or other key success factors and problems. The research for this study is based on semi-structured interviews with five informants, all native Swedish speaking professionals working in different multinational pharmaceutical companies in Sweden. Qualitative research was chosen as a way to work . Through the qualitative interview one can get access to the informants' thoughts, ideas and attitudes. Furthermore, through personal interviews, the level of ambiguity can be decreased to a minimum as clarifying questions can be asked ; compared to when questions are answered solely in writing. The questionnaire was designed with three sections of questions. The first section contains questions about communication in the workplace : who the professionals communicate with, how often, when misunderstandings occur etc. The second part of the questionnaire contains questions about previous Business English courses/education and what they would like to learn/improve in terms of business English communication. By asking what they would like to learn and improve, their answers are expected to reflect what they find problematic as well as provide information for future research on how to design an ESP course specifically for the pharmaceutical industry. The last part of the questionnaire contains questions of general information character, i.e. age, sex, level of education and so on. These questions were left for the end in order to avoid making the informants uneasy by asking personal and interrogation-like questions in the beginning. The informants all hold middle to upper management positions within pharmaceutical companies operating in Sweden. The informants were found through personal contacts but chosen based on seniority and their use of English in their profession. Furthermore, they were all native Swedish speakers and in the age group of 35-45 years old. These aspects were important in order to be able to better compare their answers. The participation in the study was anonymous and in order to ensure the informants anonymity each participant was given an identification code ranging from A to E. These codes are used in the study to identify and distinguish the informants from each other when analyzing the results. Informant A is working as a communication manager at AstraZeneca in Södertälje, Sweden. The informant has formal secondary education from Högskola/Universitet and has taken a business English course in high school. Informant B is working as a Quality Assurance Manager at Shire Human Genetics in Stockholm, Sweden. The informant has formal education and a degree from University, and has previously taken two different Business English courses. Informant C is working as Sales Manager for Scandinavian Biopharma Distribution. The informant has a formal education and a degree from University and has previously taken a course in Business English. Informant D is working as a Clinical Trials Manager at Novartis, Stockholm, Sweden. The informant has formal education from University and a degree but has never taken a Business English course. Informant E is working as a Manager Application Development at Shire Human Genetic Therapies. The informant has formal education and a degree from University but has never taken any business course. Because of the small number of participants, conclusions based on the study are not statistically proven but rather contribute to a broader understanding of the field in question which can be used as a basis for further research. Four of the five interviews were conducted in person and one over the telephone. The interviews were recorded, with the permission of the informants and transcribed immediately after the interview. Furthermore, the interviews were performed in Swedish since it is the mother tongue of all the informants. This was to ensure that they could fully explain how they felt about the issues brought up in the questions. The questions were asked in the same order as they were written but sometimes the answer to a later question was automatically answered in the discussion of an earlier question. When transcribed the answer was moved to the right question number or a reference was made referring back to the answer of previous question. After transcribing the interviews the answers were first analyzed one by one, and then organized into themes to obtain an extensive overview of the results. By putting all the informants' answers together under each question, a better view of what kinds of results each question had generated appeared. Correlations and disagreements for each of the questions became more visible. Business English was used in all media of communication, i.e., for meetings, e-mails, other written genres, telephone, interpersonal communication as well as conversation for other/social purposes. There was no clear dominance of one form over the others. However, as seen in Table 1 below, the amount of English used for informal/social communication varied greatly between the respondents. When asked how much of their work is conducted in English, all the informants answered that they speak English a major part of the time at work. However two of them said that if there are only Swedes present the communication is conducted in Swedish. Even with Danes and Norwegians they sometimes speak what the informant referred to as' Scandinavian' . One respondent said ; [ ] . Similarly informant B said that they speak English during coffee breaks only when the English-speaking IT-support is there, every other week. Only one informant said that they always use English, for informal and social purposes as well . The study showed that there is a wide variety of nationalities with whom the informants communicate, but most of the communication was conducted with people from the US, the UK and all of the European countries. Only one informant specifically reported communicating with people outside of Europe or North America, namely India In order to identify some important skills for successful Business English communication, the informants were asked to grade the importance of different communication skills . As can be seen in Table 2, all the informants seemed to agree that possessing an industry-specific vocabulary was important. For the other skills, speaking, writing, listening and social competence the answers were somewhat more varied. However all skills seems to be graded as fairly important with the exception of one informant who perceived social skills to be of little importance. When asked which nationalities they found it easiest to communicate with, the response was split. Informants A, B and E thought that NSs were easier to communicate with partly because the conversation flowed better. They were easier to understand and also, as one informant said, they can figure out what I want to say. [ ] [ . ] However, informant E also said that NSs use words and phrases that are difficult and speak fast and expect you to follow at their pace. [ ] Furthermore, informant A mentioned cultural differences as a factor of misunderstandings when speaking to NSs. She said that when speaking with people from Nordic countries she can make up her own words when needed and although the communication becomes' choppy' they can still understand each other. [ ] Informant C also pointed out that although he often finds the Finns English to be poor, they do not use difficult words and are therefore easier to understand. [ ] When asked if they think about how they sound when speaking English and if they feel a difference when speaking with NSs, two informants said that they did not think about their accent/pronunciation. The other three informants all reported that they did think about it. Informant B reported that she felt at a disadvantage when in conflict or negotiations with NS. [ ] Both informants C and D proclaimed to have better confidence when communicating with NNSs than when communicating with NSs. [ ] [ ] Informant D confessed to being more careful when speaking to NSs. [ ] When asked which situations they experience that misunderstandings often occur, two respondents said that e-mail was problematic. They both pointed out that they were sometimes seen as blunt or arrogant by NSs because of a more direct style of writing. Both informant B and E said that although e-mail was easier in the sense that one has time to think about what to write, it is also hard to get the tone of the message right and that misunderstanding can happen because of it. [ . ] [ ] One respondent did however prefer e-mail over oral communication where she felt like she was more often misunderstood. [ ] Three informants said that telephone communication was a source of misunderstandings. They mentioned not being able to hear what everyone in a big telephone meeting says, the limitations to comprehension when not face-to-face, as well as poor pronunciation as reasons. [ ] [ ] [ ] Several of the informants mentioned the fact that asking clarifying questions can be hard or they hesitate before doing it, especially in communication with NSs. [ ] Furthermore, two respondents pointed out that conflict, delivery of bad news, and negotiation/argumentation were challenging situations where misunderstandings often occurred. [ ] The findings show that all the informants said that they use English almost all the time at work and the nationalities of those they communicate with varied. Having a good industry specific vocabulary was identified by all the informants as highly important. However when communicating with NNSs words could be made up, and at the same time the informant felt more confident when communicating with NNSs. The informants found it both easier to communicate with NSs but also challenging as it sometimes was hard to follow the fast pace and they were hesitant to ask clarifying questions. The informants also confessed to be more conscious of their accent and pronunciation when speaking to NSs. As well, they often felt at a disadvantage when in situations of conflict or negotiation with NSs. The study shows that the majority of the informants use Business English during the greater part of their workday. However the study also indicates that although English dominates the work related communication, it seems as if Swedish is the preferred language for social interaction when there are no non-Swedish speakers present. Several of the participants pointed out that getting the message through and getting business done as more important than grammatical correctness or native-like pronunciation in line with Kankaanranta and Planken' s and Jenkins' research. As shown by Kankaanranta and Planken, the informants of this study similarly had a positive attitude towards simplified English and, in spite of the fact that several informants explicitly said that communication often flowed better when speaking with NSs, several of them still preferred the simpler and more direct communication with NNSs, although it could be choppy at times. This finding is in line with the research done by Kankaanranta and Planken . Kankaanranta and Planken identified three things necessary for BELF communications to be successful : facts, clarity and relations . This finding correlates to this study, as some of the important ingredients for successful communication identified by the informants included clear and simple language with fewer difficult words as well as a well established relationship with the counterpart. However, as seen in the Section 4, all the informants found a well developed industry-specific vocabulary as highly important. So at the same time as the language should be simple with few difficult words, this study indicates that there is a need for a solid knowledge of the industry-specific words in order for Business English to be successful. One informant specifically said that she could make up new words when communicating with other NNSs of Business English and they could still understand each other somehow. So by using their mother tongue and inventing new words communication is made possible. This clearly corresponds to the report by Ehrenreich that speakers of BELF adopt a pragmatic and flexible approach to language use. Several informants claimed to make up words, which correlates to Eherenreich' s findings concerning BELF speakers adopting a flexible and pragmatic approach None of the informants believed that native-like or good pronunciation was of great importance. One informant did however mention that she had a problem with the pronunciation of the outsourced department in Bangalore India. This could indicate that although pronunciation is not very important, the closer to standard American or British it is, the easier and clearer it is because we are more used to it. As seen in Section 4, the informants also highlighted the importance of live communication by specifically pointing out communication in person as much easier than through mail or telephone, as misunderstandings more often occur then. Several of the informants further mentioned being more comfortable communicating with Scandinavians or other Europeans. This could be an indication of a common bond or inherent relationship they have as \" non-native speakers \". Furthermore, Scandinavian languages and culture have many similarities which could also create an instant relationship, making it easier to communicate. One of the major challenges for NNSs when communicating with NSs is to avoid being perceived as blunt or rude. The direct style that on one hand seems to work well between NNSs, on the other hand seems to cause misunderstandings in communication with NSs. As seen in Section 4, several informants point out that they are sometimes perceived as rude or blunt when they really had no intention to. The different styles of communicating are recognized as well by Rogerson-Revell as a source for miscommunication ; . The challenge of asking clarifying questions was brought up by several informants. This supports the findings of Ehrenrich' s study mentioned earlier, i.e. that NNSs are more hesitant to ask NSs clarifying questions. This is also connected to the challenges based on the ability to process fast speech identified by Rogerson-Revell . The informants further mentioned experiencing that they are at a disadvantage in situations of negotiation, argumentation or conflict with NSs : this also correlates to Rogerson-Revell' s and Ehrenrich' s findings. Rogerson-Revell describes that Contradictory to the findings by Jenkins and Kankaanranta and Planken concerning pronunciation being of less importance, one informant did say that she had serious problems understanding the IT-support workers located in Bangalore, India. Although the English spoken may be grammatically correct, a too unfamiliar accent may complicate or even prevent successful communication. So pronunciation is perhaps not important to a certain degree, but it still has to be comprehensible to the other party of communication in order for successful information exchange to take place. This study examined in detail how five professionals in the Pharmaceutical industry in Sweden use English as a means of communication in their profession. The study gives insight into how Business English is used, what the major challenges and key success factors are. The results have shown that the Business English used by the professionals working in the pharmaceutical industry in Sweden participating in this study did not significantly differ from the BELF studied in previous research. For Business English to be successful, mixes of components need to be included, simplified, pragmatic and flexible language being one. To master an industry-specific vocabulary is also identified as important, almost a pre-requisite. Furthermore, the relationship with the other party of communication matters. A good relationship seems to inherently improve Business English communication. Finally, there seems to be a good idea for NNSs of English to pay extra attention to preparation when it comes to negotiations, delivery of bad news and conflict as those situations were identified as problematic, bestowing a sense of being at a disadvantage in the informants. Furthermore, based on the findings of my study and those of Charles, one could argue that BELF has achieved a unique identity with less focus on correctness of language and more focus on content. From this study there are several points of interest for further research that have come to light. Further research should include a larger group of informants to improve the reliability of the results as well as exploring deeper the strategies to cope with difficult situations of communication. It would also be interesting to further study how NSs experience Business English communication. Do NSs experience the same problems and what do NSs identify as success factors when communicating with NNSs. The interviews have given plenty of material for analysis. However, there are limits to the qualitative study and therefore caution is to be taken when making generalizations. Furthermore, for this study no research into written forms of communication , other than the verbal information given by informants was conducted. Being a qualitative study there are also obvious limitations as the number of people interviewed was limited to five. Nevertheless, the data collected is industry specific and depicts the views of professionals working in the Pharmaceutical sector in Sweden giving an exclusive view of their Business English experience.\n"
