# thesis-NLI
This GitHub repository contains the code used for the experiments conducted in the Masters thesis project titled "A Comparative Study of Open-Source and Closed-Source Large Language Models for Native Language Identification", by Yee Man Ng, under supervision of dr. Ilia Markov at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. 

## Structure
The folder 'code' contains all relevant code for our baselines (SVM & BERT), running open-source (LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, Mistral, Phi-3 & Gemma) and closed-source LLMs (GPT-3.5 & GPT-4) out-of-the-box, as well as fine-tuning open-source LLMs using the Unsloth library. It is recommended to run the notebooks using Google Colaboratory with the A100 GPU, as most experiments were ran with this GPU. The folder 'code' also contains the code used to preprocess the VESPA dataset to obtain the subset we used for NLI. 

The folder 'data' can be used to store the NLI datasets. The thesis made use of the TOEFL11, ICLE-NLI (a subset of the International Corpus of Learner English) and The Varieties of English for Specific Purposes dAtabase (VESPA) datasets. The dataset can be accessed and downloaded via the following website: https://corpora.uclouvain.be/catalog/en/corpus/vespa.
